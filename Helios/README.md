## ***`Background`***

this is the orgignal Helios proxy slapped together soley by me, dinguschan. its a web browser proxy thing i whipped up while absolutly zonked out of my goose, and its in NO way finished. the aim is to be a replacement for dingusProxy and a replacement for your spyware ridden admin controlled browser. the idea for this was to expand upon dingusProxy's specialized static host, clientside, local, and html css js only web proxy code and unfuck the mess of code in there. i added sandboxed tabs, specialized settings and cloaking, built in threat protection and- I JUST WANNA TO CLONE CHROME. I WANNA BLATENTLY COPY CHROME SOOOOO FUCKING BAD. ITS GONNA BE 𝘽𝙀𝙏𝙏𝙀𝙍 ITS GONNA BE 𝙁𝘼𝙎𝙏𝙀𝙍 ITS GONNA TAKE YOUR ADMINS SHITASS CENSORSHIP AND FUCK. IT. UP. BEAT THAT SHIT DOWN WITH A RUSTY STEEL PIPE WRENCH MADE OF DINGUSCHAN CERTIFIED BOMB ASS CODE. (sorry)

to use Helios you can visit one of the offical links below, or click the "Download Helios-Offline" option in the menu dropdown. you can also go through the file tree in the repository and download the "Helios-Offline.html" file to get the same result. this file can not be blocked unless your admin physically deletes the file off of your device, which was the main point of Helios, and i STRONGLY recomend doing this. you can also host this on any static or non static hosting service like Netlify, Heroku, Vercel, or whatever happens to not be blocked by your admin, or alternitivly just copy and paste into Codepen, Replit, or any WYSIWYG HTML editor on the internet for extremely quick access so it doesnt show up in your history. see more in the How To Use section.
